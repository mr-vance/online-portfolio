You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /home/vance/Documents/vance/online-portfolio

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory

? Which Firebase features do you want to set up for this directory? Press Space to select features, then Enter to confirm
 your choices. Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

i  Using project vance-muchongo (vance-muchongo)

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? public
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? No
? Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
? File public/404.html already exists. Overwrite? No
i  Skipping write of public/404.html
? File public/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No
i  Skipping write of public/index.html
